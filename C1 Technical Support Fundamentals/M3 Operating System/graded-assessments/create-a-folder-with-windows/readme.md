## Qwiklabs Overview

In this IT Support Professional Certificate, we will be using a tool called Qwiklabs to simulate many of the real-world experiences you may encounter in a tech role. In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with the Qwiklabs platform and interact with a Windows virtual machine.

## Lab Introduction

This lab will introduce you to the Qwiklabs online learning platform, powered by the Google Cloud Console. You’ll interact with Qwiklabs in lots of courses of the IT Support Professional Certificate program, so it’s important that you follow these instructions carefully. We’ll give you some background information about what Qwiklabs are, how these labs will help train you as an IT Support Specialist, and how to setup your Google Cloud Console via Qwiklabs. Finally, you’ll interact with the lab materials themselves. Ready? Let’s get started!
