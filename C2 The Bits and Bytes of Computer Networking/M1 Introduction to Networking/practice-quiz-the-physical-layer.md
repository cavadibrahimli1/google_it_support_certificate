## Question 1

What is the type of modulation used by twisted pair cable computer networks known as?

* Line crimping
* Simplex communication
* **Line coding**
* RJ45

> Line coding is the modulation of an electrical charge so that each side of a connection knows what is a one and what is a zero.

## Question 2

What's the difference between full and half duplex?

* Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
* **Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.**
* Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
* Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.

> A half duplex connection allows communication in both directions, but only one side can communicate at a time.
