# Question 1

When data can flow across a cable in both directions, this is known as _____ communication.

* ethernet
* simplex
* cross talk
* **duplex**

> Duplex communication occurs when data flows in both directions.

# Question 2

MAC address stands for ____ address.

* **media access control**
* message authentication check
* maximum allowable cost
* memory access controller 

> A MAC address is sometimes also referred to as a hardware address.

# Question 3

Something that requests data from a server is known as a ____.

* switch
* router
* server
* **client**

> A client requests data, and a server responds to that request.

# Question 4

When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another nearby wire, this is known as _____.

* duplex communication
* preamble
* **cross talk**
* multicast 

> Crosstalk is reduced by the way that wires are twisted inside of a cable.

# Question 5

UDP stands for ______.

* Unified Data Pathway
* Unknown Data Protocol
* Universal Data Protocol
* **User Datagram Protocol**

> User Datagram Protocol is one of the more common transport layer protocols.

# Question 6

What layer in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model does IP use?

* Network
* Transport
* **Data link** [INCORRECT]
* Physical 

# Question 7

Which layer in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is responsible for delivering data between two nodes?

* Data link
* Application
* **Network**
* Transport 

> The network layer is responsible for sending data between two nodes. The transport layer sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data.

# Question 8

What type of cable communicates binary data by changing the voltage between two ranges?

* Silver
* Gold
* **Copper**
* Fiber 

> Copper cables communicate binary data across wires by changing the voltage between two ranges.

# Question 9

You have installed a device at the physical layer. All of the systems you connect to this device will talk to each other at the same time. What have you installed?

* Server
* Router
* **Hub**
* Switch 

> A hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once.

# Question 10

You open a web page and log into your email. The traffic travels over many routers. What protocol will the routers use to determine the most optimal path to forward the traffic?

* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
* Internet Protocol (IP)
* **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 

> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) lets routers learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.

# Question 11

How many wires are in a standard Category 6 cable?

* **8**
* 10
* 4
* 6 

> A standard Cat6 cable has 8 wires that consist of four twisted pairs inside of a single jacket.

# Question 12

What is the most common plug used with twisted pair network cables?

* Registered Jack 35
* **Registered Jack 45**
* Registered Jack 46
* Registered Jack 11 

> Registered Jack 45 is the most common plug used in computer networking.

# Question 13

What is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when a device is free to transmit data?

* Internet Protocol (IP)
* **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)**
* Ethernet
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 

> Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when a device is free to transmit data.

# Question 14

What does the letter B represent in a Media Access Control (MAC) address?

* 10
* 15
* 9
* **11**

> Since we don't have numerals to represent any individual digit larger than 9, hexadecimal numbers employ the letters A, B, C, D, E and F to represent the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

# Question 15

What immediately follows the Start Frame Delimiter in an ethernet frame?

* **Destination Media Access Control (MAC) address**
* Frame Check Sequence
* Payload
* EtherType field 

> The destination MAC address immediately follows the Start Frame Delimiter.

# Question 16

Where is the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) found in an ethernet frame?

* **The first byte of the EtherType field** [INCORRECT]
* The last byte of the preamble
* The last byte of the EtherType field
* The first byte of the preamble
