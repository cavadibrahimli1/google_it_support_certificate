## Question 1

DNS stands for _________.

* Do Not Signal
* **Domain Name System**
* Dynamic Name Server
* Diversified Nomenclature System

> DNS stands for Domain Name System.

## Question 2

A concept that involves iterating over a list of items one by one in an orderly fashion is known as _______.

* **round robin**
* recursion
* authoritative lookup
* multiplexing

> Round robin ensures a fairly equal distribution across its members.

## Question 3

A _______ record is responsible for resolving an IP to a domain name.

* CNAME
* **PTR**
* NTP
* TXT

> PTR records operate as the inverse of an A Record.

## Question 4

The final step of the DHCP Discovery process is known as ______.

* **DHCPACK**
* DHCPOFFER
* DHCPDISCOVER
* DHCPREQUEST

> A DHCPACK is the final step in the DHCP Discovery process.

## Question 5

When NAT hides the source IP of an originating device, this is known as ________.

* port forwarding
* routing
* switching
* **IP masquerading**

> IP masquerading means that the destination will never know the actual IP of the source.

## Question 6

At the very lowest level, what data does a computer understand?

* IP (Internet Protocol) addresses
* Hexadecimal digits
* Media Access Control (MAC) addresses
* **Binary numbers**

> Binary numbers are zeros and ones. Fortunately, computers present data in a much friendlier way.

## Question 7

The "www" portion of a domain is known by which of the given options? Check all that apply.

* **Host name**
* **Subdomain**
* Top Level Domain (TLD) name
* Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

## Question 8

Which of the following allows computers on a network to automatically receive address assignment information?

* **Dynamic Host Protocol (DHCP)**
* Domain Name System (DNS)
* Time to Live (TTL)
* Primary gateway

> DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.

## Question 9

Network Address Translation (NAT) is typically implemented with which hardware devices? Check all that apply.

* Hubs
* **Routers**
* **Firewalls**
* Switches

## Question 10

An IT engineer is planning a website upgrade with load balancing features. What technology is used?

* Reverse proxy
* **Round robin** [INCORRECT]
* Web proxy
* Port forwarding
  
## Question 11

What port on a name server is used for User Datagram Protocol (UDP) name request packets?

* 25
* 80
* 22
* **53**

> DNS uses port 53 over UDP for name resolution communications.

## Question 12

A new Domain Name System (DNS) server is being configured. Which record type is used to declare a new zone?

* Name server (NS)
* **Start of Authority (SOA)**
* Pointer (PTR)
* Mail Exchanger (MX)

> An SOA record establishes a zone and maintains authority over the zone.

## Question 13

Which of the following is NOT configured by a Dynamic Host Protocol (DHCP) server?

* Internet Protocol (IP) address
* Media Access Control (MAC) address
* **Subnet mask address** [INCORRECT]
* Gateway address

## Question 14

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) uses a particular layer from the OSI reference model to carry an encrypted payload that actually contains an entire second set of packets. Which layer is used?

* Presentation
* Network
* Transport
* **Application** [INCORRECT]

## Question 15

What is the importance of using DNS?

* Get connected
* **Name resolution**
* Assigning addresses
* Securing a network

> The Domain Name System (DNS) use records to resolve numeric addresses to friendly names.

## Question 16

During the name resolution process, which technique is used to avoid congestion when querying a server?

* Redirect
* Lookup
* **Anycast**
* Hierarchy

> Anycast allows a request to be sent to an appropriate server based on factors, like location. This helps relieve severe congestion.
