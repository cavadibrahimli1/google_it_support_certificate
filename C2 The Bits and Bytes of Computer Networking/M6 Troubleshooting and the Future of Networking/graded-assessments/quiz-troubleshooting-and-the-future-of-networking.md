The ability for a protocol or program to determine that something went wrong is known as ________.

* redundancy
* data verification
* **error detection**

> Error detection is determining that an error occurred; error recovery is attempting to fix this error automatically.

## Question 2

The Linux and macOS program traceroute is known by a slightly different name on Windows. It's referred to as ______.

* tracepath
* ping

> These programs operate slightly differently and have slightly different names.

## Question 3

The IPv6 loopback address is _____.

* 127.0.0.1
* 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
* **0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001**

> The IPv6 loopback address is a great example of how IPv6 address compaction works.

## Question 4

PaaS stands for ______.

* **Platform as a Service**
* Packets as a Service
* Preamble as a Service
* Platform as a Schedule 

> PaaS enables you to run applications without requiring an entire server to do so.

## Question 5

For all IPv6 addresses, the network ID is always the first ______ bits.

* 16
* 32
* **64**
* 128 

> For all IPv6 addresses, the first 64 bits are the network ID and the last 64 bits are the host ID.

## Question 6

A support technician uses the ping utility on a system that is online, yet no response is received. What should be allowed through a firewall, for ping to operate correctly?

* TTL
* ICMP
* **Echo request** [INCORRECT]
* Echo reply 

## Question 7

You need to find the Internet Protocol (IP) address for a website. Which command do you use on a Windows system?

* netcat
* **nslookup**
* ping
* pathping 

> Using the nslookup command with a domain will return a host (A) record.

## Question 8

You need to prove ownership of a domain name for an upcoming transfer to a new registrar. Which Domain Name System (DNS) record do you create to prove ownership?

* Name Server (NS)
* **Canonical Name (CNAME)** [INCORRECT]
* Text (TXT)
* Service (SRV) 

## Question 9

As an IT decision maker, you plan to satisfy business needs by using software as a service. Which option do you deploy?

* Virtual firewall
* Windows Server 2019
* Office 365
* Linux workstation 

> Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model that uses cloud-based software, rather than locally installed software.

## Question 10

Which Internet Protocol (IP) v6 header field is used to determine the quality of service level for a datagram?

* Version
* Next header
* Flow label
* **Payload length** [INCORRECT]

## Question 11

When using the netcat command to test a network port, which option will provide output that is not useful for scripting, but is useful for the human eye?

* -z
* **-v**
* -Port
* No option is required 

> The “-v” flag, which stands for verbose, is useful as it formats the command’s output to be readable to human eyes.

## Question 12

When registering a new domain name, either the registrar's servers or self-owned servers can be used as name servers. What function will the name servers provide for the domain?

* **Authoritative** 
* Domain transfer
* Address reservation
* Error recovery 

>  An authoritative name server is responsible for a Domain Name System (DNS) zone.

## Question 13

Which addresses represent valid local loopback addresses? Check all that apply.

* ::0
* **::1**
* 255.255.255.255
* **127.0.0.1**

## Question 14

You run the Test-NetConnection command on a Windows PC while only providing a host name. As a result, what default action does the command use?

* Private tunnel
* Network address translation
* **Echo request**
* Name server lookup 

> When running the Test-NetConnection command on a Windows PC and only providing a host name, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request (ping) is used.

## Question 15

For Internet Protocol (IP) v6 traffic to travel on an IP v4 network, which two technologies are used? Check all that apply.

* **Datagrams**
* **IPv6 tunnels**
* IPv4 Tunnels
* Packets 

## Question 16

When shortening an Internet Protocol (IP) v6 address, which two rules are used? Check all that apply.

* Removing all leading zeros.
* **Removing all leading ones.**
* Replace groups of ones with semicolons.
